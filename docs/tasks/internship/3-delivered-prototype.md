# AI Agent and UI Prototype: Core Definition

## Objective
Create an AI-powered interface where users interact using natural language, while the system handles complex backend operations transparently.

## Key Components

1. **Natural Language Interface (Frontend)**
   - Users input queries and commands in plain text
   - No technical knowledge required from users

2. **AI Agent (Backend)**
   - Powered by LangChain and OpenAI's GPT-3.5
   - Interprets user requests and orchestrates appropriate actions

3. **Integrated Services**
   - QuestDB: For data storage and retrieval
   - Grafana: For data visualization
   - Code-Server: For script execution and file management

## Core Functionality

- Translate natural language inputs into technical operations
- Execute database queries, generate visualizations, and run scripts without exposing technical details
- Provide results and summaries in natural language or as simple visualizations

## Key Features

- Abstraction of technical complexity
- Modular architecture for easy expansion
- Focus on user-friendly, natural language interactions
