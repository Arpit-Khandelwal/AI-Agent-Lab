### Learning QuestDB and Grafana

As part of your internship, it's crucial to develop a solid understanding of two key tools: **QuestDB** and **Grafana**. These tools form the backbone of our data management and visualization processes in the **AI Agent Lab**. This section will guide you through the basics of both and how you will use them in your work.

#### QuestDB: High-Performance SQL Database

**QuestDB** is a fast and efficient time-series database designed for high-speed data ingestion and querying. In the AI Agent Lab, QuestDB is used to store live financial market data streams and provide fast, real-time access to this data through SQL queries.

Key concepts to learn in QuestDB:

1. **Time-Series Data**:
   - Learn how to handle time-series data efficiently. QuestDB is optimized for this type of data, which includes live market data such as stock prices, cryptocurrency values, and other financial indicators.
   
2. **SQL Queries for Technical Analysis**:
   - You will use SQL to query the database for technical analysis indicators. These include queries for moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), MACD, and more. You will be provided with a set of query templates to get started, which you can customize and extend.
   
3. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Understand how data is ingested into QuestDB. This involves learning about how live data streams (such as market prices) are continuously added to the database and how you can query this data in real-time.

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Learn how to optimize your SQL queries to ensure they return data quickly, even as the volume of data in QuestDB grows.

Resources for learning:
- [QuestDB Documentation](https://questdb.io/docs/)
- Pre-built SQL templates in the AI Agent Lab for technical analysis queries.

#### Grafana: Real-Time Data Visualization

**Grafana** is a powerful open-source platform for monitoring and visualizing data from various sources, including databases like QuestDB. In the **AI Agent Lab**, Grafana is used to visualize live data streams and the results of your technical analysis and machine learning models.

Key concepts to learn in Grafana:

1. **Dashboards and Panels**:
   - Learn how to create and configure Grafana dashboards. These dashboards display live data from QuestDB, providing a visual representation of the technical analysis results. For example, you can visualize moving averages or price trends on a real-time graph.
   
2. **Data Sources**:
   - Understand how Grafana connects to QuestDB as a data source. You will work with predefined dashboards that pull live market data from QuestDB, but youâ€™ll also be expected to create your own panels for specific analyses.
   
3. **Alerts and Notifications**:
   - Set up alerts in Grafana that trigger based on certain conditions, such as a sudden change in stock prices or a pattern detected by a machine learning model.
   
4. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Use Grafana to monitor the overall system performance of the AI Agent Lab, including data ingestion rates, query response times, and system health metrics.

Resources for learning:
- [Grafana Documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/)
- Pre-configured Grafana dashboards in the AI Agent Lab for reference.

Both QuestDB and Grafana are integral to your work in processing and visualizing financial data streams. Spend time getting comfortable with these tools as they will greatly enhance your ability to develop effective data processing and analysis scripts.


### Estimated Duration

This task, including the learning of cutting-edge technologies that may not yet be fully understood by the intern, is expected to take approximately 1 month to complete.

If you have any questions or need guidance on which areas to focus on, don't hesitate to ask. Good luck, and welcome aboard!
