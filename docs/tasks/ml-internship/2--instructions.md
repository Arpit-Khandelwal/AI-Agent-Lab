### **Internship Instructions: Forking the Project and Using AI Agent Lab**

1. **Fork the Project**  
   - Begin by forking the project repository to your own GitHub account.
   - Ensure you regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository to stay updated with the latest changes.

2. **Set Up the AI Agent Lab Devbox**  
   - Use the **AI Agent Lab** as your dedicated development environment (devbox). This is mandatory for all tasks.
   - The **AI Agent Lab** is already set up with Docker, QuestDB, Code Server, Grafana, and other essential tools. 
   - You will need to use this stack to develop, test, and debug
  
3. **Work in the Notebooks Folder**  
   - All development, particularly related to machine learning and data stream processing, must be done in the **notebooks** folder.
   - Ensure that all code, experiments, and analysis are organized clearly within this folder.
   - Any auxiliary files or scripts should be linked appropriately to the relevant notebooks.

4. **Perform Tasks on the Provided Dedicated Server**  
   - We will provide you with access to a **dedicated server** to perform all development tasks.
   - The dedicated server will ensure that your work environment is isolated and optimized for development.
   - You will receive login credentials and instructions for accessing the server.

5. **Documentation and Updates**  
   - Document any changes you make to the codebase in detail. This includes new features, bug fixes, or optimizations.
   - Keep track of your progress, and provide regular status updates to the team.

6. **Communicate Any Issues**  
   - If you encounter any issues with the setup or tasks, communicate them as soon as possible so they can be addressed.
