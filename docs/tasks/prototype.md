# AI Agent and AI Agent UI Prototype Definition (Natural Language Focus)

## Objective:
The goal is to develop a foundational **AI Agent and AI Agent UI prototype** where users interact **exclusively through natural language**. The backend, powered by **LangChain**, will handle all interactions with external services such as **QuestDB**, **Grafana**, **Code-Server**, and **OpenAI** via their APIs. The prototype will abstract away all technical details, allowing users to ask questions and issue commands in plain text, while the AI Agent translates those requests into the necessary backend operations.

## AI Agent Prototype (Backend)

### 1. Interaction with OpenAI (GPT-3.5):
- The AI agent uses **GPT-3.5** to process user requests and understand the intent behind the natural language input.
- The AI agent identifies whether the user query requires data from QuestDB, visualizations from Grafana, or actions in Code-Server, based on the context.

### 2. LangChain’s Tool Management:
- **LangChain** will orchestrate the flow of API requests. Depending on the task (data retrieval, visualization, script execution), it will determine the necessary tools to fulfill the user’s request.
- For example, LangChain will decide whether to retrieve data from **QuestDB**, call the **Grafana API** for visualization, or interact with **Code-Server** to run a script.

### 3. QuestDB Integration (SQL Queries Abstracted):
- When the user asks a data-related question (e.g., "What was the average Bitcoin price last week?"), GPT-3.5 translates the natural language input into an appropriate **SQL query**.
- The **SQLDatabaseChain module** in LangChain interacts with QuestDB by generating the query and executing it behind the scenes. The user is unaware of the SQL query, seeing only the result in plain text or as a summary.
- For example, QuestDB might return the average price, which GPT-3.5 will summarize as: "The average Bitcoin price last week was $27,500."

### 4. Grafana Integration (Visualization):
- If the user requests a visualization (e.g., "Show me the price trend for Bitcoin last week"), **LangChain** will call the **Grafana API** to generate a time-series chart.
- Instead of displaying the raw data, the user will be given a link that displays the result visually.

### 5. Code-Server Interaction (File/Script Automation):
- The AI agent can also interact with **Code-Server** to automate tasks such as running scripts or managing files based on user commands.
- For example, a user might ask: "Run the data processing script for market data," and the AI agent will trigger the appropriate action in Code-Server without exposing the technical steps to the user.

## AI Agent UI Prototype (Frontend)

### 1. Natural Language Interface:
- The UI will provide a **text input box** where users can interact with the AI agent through natural language.
- The interface will be clean and simple, focusing on allowing users to input queries like:
  - "What is the latest stock price for Bitcoin?"
  - "Show me a chart of Bitcoin prices over the last week."
  - "Run the script to process market data."
- The AI Agent processes these requests and provides results without requiring the user to know any technical details.

### 2. Task Automation:
- The AI agent will automate backend tasks based on natural language requests, such as:
  - **Fetching data** from QuestDB.
  - **Generating visualizations** through Grafana.
  - **Running scripts** in Code-Server.
- Users will only see the results (e.g., a summary from GPT-3.5 or a link to a Grafana dashboard).

### 3. Quick Links and Feedback:
- The UI will offer **quick links** for users to navigate to detailed views in **QuestDB** or **Grafana**, if they need to explore the data further.
- The system will also display feedback like "Data retrieved successfully" or "Script executed" to confirm task completion.

### 4. No Display of Raw Data:
- The user interface will not display raw SQL queries, database outputs, or other technical details. Instead, all interactions will be in **natural language**, and results will be returned as **summaries** or **visualizations** as requested by the user.

## Technical Problem Solving: AI Agent Lab Use Cases with LangChain and OpenAI API

### Use Case 1: Data Analysis Assistance
Given a large dataset in **QuestDB** that tracks the **price of Bitcoin** over an extended period, a user might ask:
- "Summarize the movement of the BTC price in the past one month."
- "Identify the highest price spikes and explain potential causes."

#### Process:
1. **QuestDB retrieves the raw data**:
   - QuestDB executes an SQL query to pull the relevant price data (e.g., price readings and timestamps) over the past month.

2. **GPT-3.5 processes and analyzes the data**:
   - **LangChain’s SQLDatabaseChain module** sends the retrieved data to GPT-3.5, which processes the trends in the price movement.
   - GPT-3.5 then **summarizes** the data, providing a natural language explanation such as: 
     - "The price of Bitcoin peaked on [specific date] due to [possible reasons], with the average price increasing by X% over the month."

#### Benefit:
- This setup provides a **natural language interface** between the user and vast datasets, abstracting away the technical complexity of data retrieval and analysis.

### Use Case 2: Report Generation for Trend Analysis
A user might ask the AI Agent to generate a report, such as:
- "Generate a summary report for energy usage trends in the past 24 hours."

#### Process:
1. **QuestDB retrieves the raw data**:
   - QuestDB runs a query to fetch data on energy usage over the last 24 hours.

2. **GPT-3.5 generates the report**:
   - **LangChain** passes the raw data to GPT-3.5, which analyzes the energy usage patterns.
   - GPT-3.5 generates a **narrative report**, summarizing the findings:
     - "Over the last 24 hours, energy usage was stable except for a surge at 3 PM, likely due to an industrial peak."

#### Benefit:
- This enables **automated report generation**, where users can ask for real-time analysis of data without manually analyzing the raw dataset themselves.

---

### Role of **Grafana**:
- **Real-Time Dashboards**: Grafana can be used to display real-time dashboards that visually represent data trends.
- **GPT-3.5 Complement**: GPT-3.5 can complement the visual data by providing **written analysis** or identifying **specific patterns** that are not immediately visible in the graphs.
  - For example: "The spike at 3 PM corresponds to an operational shift in the plant, causing a surge in energy usage."

## Foundation for Future Development:
This prototype serves as the base for more complex future features. The architecture will remain modular, allowing new services to be added easily without altering the fundamental design. The focus will always remain on **natural language interaction** to abstract the technical complexity from the user.

### Key Features:
- **Natural Language Processing**: The AI Agent will process all user interactions through the OpenAI GPT-3.5 API, interpreting requests and issuing the necessary backend actions.
- **LangChain Tool Chaining**: LangChain will manage API interactions, determining which tools (QuestDB, Grafana, Code-Server) to use based on the user’s request, and will execute the necessary operations without exposing technical details.
- **Orchestration of Services**: The AI Agent will automate interactions with QuestDB, Grafana, and Code-Server, ensuring seamless execution of tasks in response to natural language input.
- **Modular Architecture**: Each service is modular, allowing future expansion of the AI Agent's capabilities without significant architectural changes.
