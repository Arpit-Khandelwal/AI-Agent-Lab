## AI Agent and AI Agent UI Prototype Definition

### Objective:
The goal is to build a simple yet robust AI Agent and AI Agent UI prototype that interacts with **QuestDB**, **Grafana**, **Code-Server**, and **OpenAI** via their APIs, without directly displaying database query results or visualizations in the UI. This prototype will serve as a strong foundation for future feature development while keeping the core architecture intact.

### AI Agent Prototype (Backend)

1. **Interaction with OpenAI API**:
   - Allow the AI agent to take user input (e.g., a question or query) and process it using the OpenAI GPT model.
   - The response from OpenAI can be returned as simple text output or logged in the backend.

2. **Interaction with QuestDB API**:
   - Enable the AI agent to execute predefined SQL queries on QuestDB via its API.
   - Focus on triggering queries without displaying the results in the UI.
   - The query results will be available for further visualization in Grafana or through direct access to QuestDB’s console.

3. **Interaction with Grafana API**:
   - Allow the AI agent to trigger updates or fetch predefined dashboards from Grafana.
   - Instead of visualizing data in the AI Agent UI, provide quick links to open specific Grafana dashboards in a new tab.

4. **Interaction with Code-Server API**:
   - Integrate the AI agent with Code-Server for simple task automation, such as opening predefined files or running scripts.
   - Provide triggers to open Code-Server directly from the UI rather than displaying content in the UI.

### AI Agent UI Prototype (Frontend)

1. **Task Orchestration**:
   - The UI will provide a simple interface for triggering tasks like:
     - Sending user input to OpenAI.
     - Executing predefined SQL queries on QuestDB.
     - Opening or running files in Code-Server.
     - Triggering specific visualizations in Grafana.
   
2. **Quick Navigation**:
   - Instead of displaying data or visualizations, the UI will offer links or buttons to quickly navigate to **QuestDB**, **Grafana**, or **Code-Server** through their HTTPS interfaces.
   - Users can view their data or results directly within those secure tools.

3. **Status and Logs**:
   - Display brief status messages or logs (e.g., “Query executed successfully,” “Data sent to Grafana,” or “File opened in Code-Server”) to inform users of task completion.
   - No detailed data or visualizations will be displayed in the UI.

### Foundation for Future Development:
This simple prototype will serve as the foundation for building more complex features, ensuring that the core architecture remains intact as new functionalities are added. The focus is on modularity and scalability, allowing additional APIs or integrations to be implemented without needing to overhaul the existing codebase.

### Key Features:
- **Simple and Clean UI**: Focused on task orchestration, providing users with a lightweight, easy-to-use interface.
- **Modular Backend**: Each API integration (OpenAI, QuestDB, Grafana, Code-Server) is modular, enabling future expansion without significant refactoring.
- **Secure Direct Access**: Users can access detailed data and visualizations directly in **QuestDB**, **Grafana**, and **Code-Server** via HTTPS, ensuring that the AI Agent UI remains focused on automation and task management.
