# Auto-GPT-Lab-Plugin


Auto-GPT-Lab is an all-in-one development environment for working with the GPT-3.5 architecture, designed to facilitate rapid experimentation and testing of language models. The plugin includes a docker-compose configuration with QuestDB, Grafana, and Code-Server, providing a seamless interface for managing and querying data, visualizing results, and coding in real-time. With Auto-GPT-Lab, users can quickly set up a notebook environment and start experimenting with GPT-3.5 models, without the need for complex setup or configuration

Auto-GPT-Lab is also the basis for the AI Agent Farm, a modular system for developing and deploying AI agents. By using Auto-GPT-Lab as a module in the AI Agent Farm, users can easily connect their agents to real-time data streams and other sources of information, allowing for more sophisticated and accurate decision-making. With its flexible and modular design, Auto-GPT-Lab is a powerful tool for anyone working with GPT-3.5 models and data streams in their AI applications.
