# Internship Getting Started Guide

## Welcome to the AI Agent Lab!

We are excited to have you as a part of the team working on our cutting-edge AI Agent Lab project focused on live data stream processing for market data. This guide will help you get started and provide an overview of your responsibilities, tools, and the workflow you’ll follow during the internship.

### Project Overview

The **AI Agent Lab** is a platform for processing live data streams, particularly focused on financial market data, with the integration of machine learning (ML) models. Your primary task will be to create sets of Jupyter notebooks that process live market data and analyze it using machine learning algorithms, while utilizing SQL queries from the database for technical analysis indicators.

### Internship Role and Responsibilities

You will focus on developing notebooks that process and analyze live data streams, utilizing SQL query-based indicators for technical analysis. The notebooks should provide users with a streamlined workflow for real-time analysis of market data. Your specific responsibilities include:

1. **Data Stream Processing Notebooks:**
   - Create notebooks that handle live data streams (e.g., stock prices, cryptocurrency).
   - Use SQL queries from the database to perform technical analysis on this data (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD).
   - Ensure the data stream processing is optimized for real-time performance.

2. **Machine Learning Notebooks:**
   - Develop ML notebooks that use the processed data for tasks such as:
     - Predicting market trends (regression models)
     - Pattern detection (clustering, classification)
     - Time-series forecasting for financial markets
   - Integrate models with data returned from SQL queries for a smooth workflow.

3. **Optimization for GPT-3.5:**
   - Ensure the notebooks are designed to interact effectively with the GPT-3.5 models, allowing users to query the data and ML models in real-time.
   - Create simple, clear workflows that new users can easily follow.

4. **Exploring Additional Data Sources:**
   - Investigate potential integration with other live data sources such as Twitter, financial news, or additional APIs to provide more context for your analysis.

5. **Collaboration and Documentation:**
   - Collaborate with the team to ensure seamless integration of the notebooks into the AI Agent Lab.
   - Document your process and solutions, providing clear instructions for users on how to use your notebooks and query the database.

### Tools and Technologies

Here’s a list of the main tools and technologies you’ll be working with:

- **Python**: Primary language for notebook development.
- **SQL Queries**: For technical indicators and querying data from the database.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch/Scikit-learn**: Machine learning libraries for model implementation.
- **Pandas/NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Docker**: The AI Agent Lab runs in a Dockerized environment, so you will need to ensure your notebooks are compatible with our Docker setup.
- **Grafana**: For data visualization (integrated via database links).
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Your primary development environment.
- **GPT-3.5**: Language model for querying and interfacing with the AI Agent Lab.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Getting Started

1. **Access the Repository:**
   - Clone the AI Agent Lab repository to your local development environment.
   - Familiarize yourself with the project structure, particularly focusing on the `ta-library` folder for SQL queries related to technical indicators.

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment:**
   - Ensure that you have Python and the required libraries installed.
   - Access the AI Agent Lab Docker environment following the instructions provided in the repository README.

3. **Understand SQL-based Technical Indicators:**
   - Review the `ta-library` folder containing SQL queries for common technical indicators such as moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc.
   - These SQL queries will be used to perform technical analysis in your notebooks.

4. **Start with Data Stream Processing:**
   - Develop your first notebook focused on live data stream ingestion (market data).
   - Use SQL queries from the database to perform technical analysis on the data.

5. **Integrate Machine Learning Models:**
   - In the second notebook, implement a machine learning model that processes the technical analysis results from the SQL queries.
   - Ensure the model is optimized for real-time data analysis.

6. **Test and Optimize for Real-time Use:**
   - Test your notebooks to ensure they handle real-time data streams efficiently.
   - Use performance optimizations such as indexing in SQL queries where necessary.

7. **Create User-friendly Templates:**
   - Make sure your notebooks are designed for easy use, especially for users who may not be experts in ML or SQL.
   - Provide clear instructions and modular components so users can easily adapt the notebooks to their own data.

8. **Collaboration and Feedback:**
   - Regularly update the team on your progress and seek feedback.
   - Make necessary adjustments based on team input to improve the notebooks' functionality and usability.

### Intern Expectations

- **Timeline**: Your internship begins on October 1, 2024, and lasts for 3 months. Ensure you meet your milestones as per the project’s timeline.
- **Collaboration**: Be active in communicating with the team and contributing ideas.
- **Documentation**: Keep all your code and documentation well-organized for future users.
- **Deliverables**: The final deliverables include a series of Jupyter notebooks ready for users to process live data streams and apply machine learning models using SQL queries for technical analysis.

### Final Note

We’re excited to see your contributions to the **AI Agent Lab** project! Your role in utilizing SQL-based technical analysis will be instrumental in making the lab more flexible and robust. Should you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to reach out to the team.
