# Internship Getting Started Guide

## Overview

Welcome to the AI Agent Lab internship! Your first task is to explore, understand, and contribute to the **SOTA (State-of-the-Art)** folder, which contains foundational research relevant to the development of the AI Agent Lab.

### 1. **Start with the SOTA Folder**

Your primary responsibility is to begin by reviewing the **SOTA folder**. This folder contains research and resources that provide insights into the state-of-the-art methodologies, frameworks, and tools in AI development. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

> "This folder contains research and resources related to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in the fields relevant to the development of the AI Agent Lab. The research compiled here provides foundational insights into current methodologies, frameworks, and tools, guiding the design and development of the lab's infrastructure and functionalities."

### 2. **Add New Research and Then Create the SOTA Summary**

- **Conduct new research** by finding and adding recent academic papers, industry reports, and new frameworks or tools related to AI Agent development.
- After expanding the **SOTA folder** with this new research, **create the SOTA_Summary.pdf** to provide a high-level overview of the key methodologies, tools, and trends in AI development relevant to the AI Agent Lab.

### Key Tasks:
- **Review existing content:** Start by reading through the papers, reports, and notes in the SOTA folder.
- **Conduct new research:** Find new academic papers, industry trends, and frameworks relevant to AI Agent Lab development.
- **Update the SOTA folder:** Add the new research to the appropriate sections, such as the Bibliography, Research Notes, or Papers folders.
- **Create the SOTA Summary:** Once the new research is compiled, create the **SOTA_Summary.pdf** for a high-level overview of the research.

If you have any questions or need guidance on which areas to focus on, don't hesitate to ask. Good luck, and welcome aboard!
