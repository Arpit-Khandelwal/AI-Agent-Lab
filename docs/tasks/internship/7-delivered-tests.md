## Task: Build Test Documentation

### Instructions:
1. **File**: Use the `delivered-tests.md` file as the destination for documenting the tests.
2. **Test Details**: Document all relevant tests, ensuring to **separate the tests for connections** from the **tests related to the user interface**.

### Structure:

#### **Connection Tests**:
- These tests should focus on verifying that the different services (e.g., AI Agent, QuestDB, Grafana, code-server, etc.) can communicate and interact with each other correctly.

#### **User Interface Tests**:
- These tests should verify that the user interface (AI Agent UI) functions properly, handling user inputs and returning correct responses.

### Example Structure:

```markdown
## Connection Tests

### Test Case 1: AI Agent to QuestDB Connection
- **Description**: Verify that the AI Agent can successfully query QuestDB.
- **Steps**:
  1. Send a query from the AI Agent to QuestDB.
  2. Check the response time and data retrieval.
- **Expected Outcome**: The AI Agent should retrieve data from QuestDB successfully.
- **Actual Outcome**: Data was retrieved in 450ms.
- **Status**: Passed

### Test Case 2: AI Agent to OpenAI API
- **Description**: Ensure the AI Agent can interact with the OpenAI API.
- **Steps**:
  1. Send a query from the AI Agent to the OpenAI API.
  2. Check the response for accuracy and timeliness.
- **Expected Outcome**: The API should return a valid response to the AI Agent.
- **Actual Outcome**: Received the expected response from the OpenAI API.
- **Status**: Passed

## User Interface Tests

### Test Case 1: AI Agent UI Response
- **Description**: Validate that the AI Agent UI returns responses from the AI Agent.
- **Steps**:
  1. User sends a text query through the UI.
  2. Query is processed by the AI Agent.
  3. Response is returned to the UI.
- **Expected Outcome**: The AI Agent UI should return the correct response based on the user's query.
- **Actual Outcome**: The system returned the expected response.
- **Status**: Passed

### Test Case 2: UI Error Handling
- **Description**: Test how the AI Agent UI handles invalid or unexpected user inputs.
- **Steps**:
  1. User sends an invalid query.
  2. Check if the UI displays an error message.
- **Expected Outcome**: The UI should show an appropriate error message.
- **Actual Outcome**: The system displayed the expected error message.
- **Status**: Passed
