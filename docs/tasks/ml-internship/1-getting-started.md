# Internship Getting Started Guide

## Welcome to the AI Agent Lab!

We are excited to have you as a part of the team working on our cutting-edge AI Agent Lab project focused on live data stream processing for market data. This guide will help you get started and provide an overview of your responsibilities, tools, and the workflow you’ll follow during the internship.

### Project Overview

The **AI Agent Lab** is a platform for processing live data streams, particularly focused on financial market data, with the integration of machine learning (ML) models. Your primary task will be to create Python scripts that process live market data and analyze it using machine learning algorithms, while utilizing SQL queries from the database for technical analysis indicators.

### Internship Role and Responsibilities

You will focus on developing Python scripts that process and analyze live data streams, utilizing SQL query-based indicators for technical analysis. The scripts should provide users with a streamlined workflow for real-time analysis of market data. Your specific responsibilities include:

1. **Data Stream Processing Scripts:**
   - Create Python scripts that handle live data streams (e.g., stock prices, cryptocurrency).
   - Use SQL queries from the database to perform technical analysis on this data (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD).
   - Ensure the data stream processing is optimized for real-time performance.

2. **Machine Learning Scripts:**
   - Develop Python scripts that use the processed data for tasks such as:
     - Predicting market trends (regression models)
     - Pattern detection (clustering, classification)
     - Time-series forecasting for financial markets
   - Integrate models with data returned from SQL queries for a smooth workflow.

3. **Optimization for GPT-3.5:**
   - Ensure the scripts are designed to interact effectively with the GPT-3.5 models, allowing users to query the data and ML models in real-time.
   - Create simple, clear workflows that new users can easily follow.

4. **Exploring Additional Data Sources:**
   - Investigate potential integration with other live data sources such as Twitter, financial news, or additional APIs to provide more context for your analysis.

5. **Collaboration and Documentation:**
   - Collaborate with the team to ensure seamless integration of the scripts into the AI Agent Lab.
   - Document your process and solutions, providing clear instructions for users on how to use your scripts and query the database.

### Tools and Technologies

Here’s a list of the main tools and technologies you’ll be working with:

- **Python**: Primary language for script development.
- **SQL Queries**: For technical indicators and querying data from the database.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch/Scikit-learn**: Machine learning libraries for model implementation.
- **Pandas/NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Docker**: The AI Agent Lab runs in a Dockerized environment, so you will need to ensure your scripts are compatible with our Docker setup.
- **Grafana**: For data visualization (integrated via database links).
- **GPT-3.5**: Language model for querying and interfacing with the AI Agent Lab.

### Why We Need These Processing Files

The **AI Agent Lab** requires a set of predefined processing templates to ensure that data science users, students, professionals, and researchers have ready-to-use tools for handling live data streams. These files are essential for several reasons:

1. **Ease of Use**:  
   By providing pre-built templates, we remove the complexity of setting up live data stream processors from scratch. This allows users to focus on their core tasks—whether it's data analysis, research, or development—without needing to spend time on configuration.

2. **Accessibility for All Skill Levels**:  
   These processing files are designed to be easily accessible for a wide range of users, from beginners in data science to experienced professionals. By having ready-to-use templates, students and researchers can dive directly into experimentation and analysis without needing to build the system's infrastructure.

3. **Accelerating Research and Development**:  
   For professionals and researchers, time is critical. Ready-to-use processing files provide a jump-start to their projects, allowing them to focus on data insights and model optimization rather than building custom data ingestion pipelines.

4. **Standardized Workflow**:  
   The templates establish a standardized workflow across different user groups, ensuring consistency in how data is processed and analyzed. This reduces errors, ensures best practices are followed, and makes collaboration easier across various teams and disciplines.
