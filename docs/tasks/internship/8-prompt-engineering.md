## Task: Create Optimized Engineering Prompts for Financial Data

### Instructions:
1. **File**: Use the `prompt-engineering.md` file to document the optimized prompts you create.
2. **Objective**: Engineer prompts that return the most optimized and relevant responses related to financial data, particularly focusing on cryptocurrencies like **Bitcoin**. The prompts should aim to retrieve actionable insights, summaries, or forecasts.

### Key Guidelines for Financial Data Prompt Engineering:

- **Financial Focus**: Ensure the prompts are centered around financial data, such as price movements, technical analysis, trends, and market forecasts. You may also include economic indicators and their impacts on cryptocurrency prices.
- **Clarity**: Make sure the prompts are clear, concise, and specific to financial data. Ambiguity could lead to inaccurate financial responses.
- **Context**: Provide essential context, such as timeframes, data points, or specific financial metrics (e.g., price changes, market cap).
- **Conciseness**: Make the prompts as focused as possible to generate precise financial insights.
- **Iterative Testing**: After testing the prompts, optimize them for better responses in terms of accuracy, relevance, and efficiency.

### Example Prompt Structures for Financial Data:

1. **Price Trend Analysis**:
   - Focus on recent trends in cryptocurrency prices.
   - **Example**: "Analyze the Bitcoin price trends over the past 7 days and summarize the key changes."

2. **Market Sentiment**:
   - Ask the AI to evaluate market sentiment based on given data.
   - **Example**: "Based on the following news headlines, determine the current market sentiment around Bitcoin: [Insert News Headlines]."

3. **Financial Forecast**:
   - Request a forecast or prediction for a specific cryptocurrency.
   - **Example**: "Provide a 7-day Bitcoin price forecast based on recent market data and trends."

4. **Impact of Economic Indicators**:
   - Analyze how global economic events or indicators affect the financial market.
   - **Example**: "How did the recent Federal Reserve interest rate hike impact Bitcoin's price in the past 24 hours?"

5. **Risk Analysis**:
   - Ask for a risk assessment of investing in a particular cryptocurrency at the moment.
   - **Example**: "Assess the risks of investing in Bitcoin in the current market conditions, considering the volatility over the past month."

### Deliverable:
For each prompt, document the following in the **`prompt-engineering.md`** file:
- **Prompt**: The financial data-focused prompt.
- **Objective**: The goal or task the prompt is trying to achieve (e.g., analyzing Bitcoin trends, predicting prices).
- **Test Results**: Notes on how the AI responded to the prompt, including the relevance and optimization of the financial response.
- **Iterations**: List any adjustments made to the prompt and the resulting improvements in the AIâ€™s responses.

### Example Entry:

```markdown
### Prompt: 
"Analyze the Bitcoin price trends over the past 7 days and summarize the key changes."

- **Objective**: To generate an accurate and concise summary of recent Bitcoin price movements.
- **Test Results**: The initial response included too much historical data outside the requested 7-day window.
- **Iteration 1**: Adjusted prompt to: "Analyze only the Bitcoin price trends for the past 7 days and summarize the key changes."
- **Outcome**: The response was refined to focus on the correct timeframe. Optimized.
