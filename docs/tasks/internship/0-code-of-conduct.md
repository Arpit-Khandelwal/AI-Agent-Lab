# Internship Code of Conduct

## Purpose:
Our goal is to foster an environment that values continuous learning, personal development, and the delivery of high-quality work. Interns are encouraged to grow at their own pace while contributing effectively to the project.

## Core Values:
1. **Learning-Focused**: We prioritize the ability to learn and adapt. The internship is a space where questions are encouraged, and mistakes are seen as opportunities for growth.
   
2. **Quality Over Quantity**: We value the production of thoughtful, well-executed work rather than focusing on output volume. Interns should take the time necessary to ensure that their contributions are reliable, efficient, and of high quality.

3. **No Pressure Environment**: There is no expectation to work beyond your limits. Interns are encouraged to communicate openly about workloads and deadlines, with the understanding that personal well-being and a balanced approach to tasks are essential.

1. **Embrace Continuous Learning**: You are encouraged to explore new ideas, ask questions, and seek guidance when needed. Your ability to learn and adapt is a key metric of success.

2. **Focus on Quality**: Every task should reflect careful thought and attention to detail. Quality work is more important than the number of tasks completed.

3. **Effective Communication**: If you're unsure about something or need more time, ask for clarification or an extension. Clear communication with the team ensures everyone stays on the same page.

4. **Respect Deadlines and Deliverables**: We understand that quality work takes time, but staying organized and managing your time effectively helps ensure that tasks are completed within a reasonable timeframe.

5. **Collaboration and Feedback**: You’re part of a team. We value open collaboration and constructive feedback. Use feedback as a tool to improve, and don’t hesitate to share your own insights.

6. **Work-Life Balance**: While learning and productivity are important, maintaining a healthy work-life balance is critical. You are encouraged to set boundaries and prioritize self-care.
