# Internship Getting Started Guide

## Welcome to the AI Agent Lab!

We are excited to have you as a part of the team working on our cutting-edge AI Agent Lab project focused on live data stream processing for market data. This guide will help you get started and provide an overview of your responsibilities, tools, and the workflow you’ll follow during the internship.

### Project Overview

The **AI Agent Lab** is a platform for processing live data streams, particularly focused on financial market data, with the integration of machine learning (ML) models. Your primary task will be to create sets of Jupyter notebooks that process live market data and analyze it using machine learning algorithms, while utilizing SQL queries from the database for technical analysis indicators.

### Internship Role and Responsibilities

You will focus on developing notebooks that process and analyze live data streams, utilizing SQL query-based indicators for technical analysis. The notebooks should provide users with a streamlined workflow for real-time analysis of market data. Your specific responsibilities include:

1. **Data Stream Processing Notebooks:**
   - Create notebooks that handle live data streams (e.g., stock prices, cryptocurrency).
   - Use SQL queries from the database to perform technical analysis on this data (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD).
   - Ensure the data stream processing is optimized for real-time performance.

2. **Machine Learning Notebooks:**
   - Develop ML notebooks that use the processed data for tasks such as:
     - Predicting market trends (regression models)
     - Pattern detection (clustering, classification)
     - Time-series forecasting for financial markets
   - Integrate models with data returned from SQL queries for a smooth workflow.

3. **Optimization for GPT-3.5:**
   - Ensure the notebooks are designed to interact effectively with the GPT-3.5 models, allowing users to query the data and ML models in real-time.
   - Create simple, clear workflows that new users can easily follow.

4. **Exploring Additional Data Sources:**
   - Investigate potential integration with other live data sources such as Twitter, financial news, or additional APIs to provide more context for your analysis.

5. **Collaboration and Documentation:**
   - Collaborate with the team to ensure seamless integration of the notebooks into the AI Agent Lab.
   - Document your process and solutions, providing clear instructions for users on how to use your notebooks and query the database.

### Tools and Technologies

Here’s a list of the main tools and technologies you’ll be working with:

- **Python**: Primary language for notebook development.
- **SQL Queries**: For technical indicators and querying data from the database.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch/Scikit-learn**: Machine learning libraries for model implementation.
- **Pandas/NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Docker**: The AI Agent Lab runs in a Dockerized environment, so you will need to ensure your notebooks are compatible with our Docker setup.
- **Grafana**: For data visualization (integrated via database links).
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Your primary development environment.
- **GPT-3.5**: Language model for querying and interfacing with the AI Agent Lab.
