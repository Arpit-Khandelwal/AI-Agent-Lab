## Task: Build Test Documentation

### Instructions:
1. **File**: Use the `delivered-tests.md` file as the destination for documenting the tests.
2. **Test Categories**: Separate the tests into **Connection Tests** (related to the code snippets from the `code-snippets` folder) and **User Interface Tests**.

### Structure:

#### **Connection Tests**:
- These tests should focus on validating the connections between the AI Agent and external services, as described in the `code-snippets` folder's README. This includes:
  - **Code-server (VSCode)**: Validating the secure connection and authentication with the code-server.
  - **QuestDB**: Ensuring the AI Agent can connect to QuestDB via PostgreSQL or REST API.
  - **Grafana**: Verifying the AI Agent's ability to interact with Grafana's API for managing dashboards and visualizing data.
  - **OpenAI API**: Testing the AI Agent's connection to the OpenAI API for AI-related tasks.

### Example Structure for Connection Tests:

```markdown
## Connection Tests

### Test Case 1: Code-Server (VSCode) Connection Validation
- **Description**: Ensure the AI Agent can securely connect and authenticate with the code-server instance over HTTPS.
- **Steps**:
  1. Write a script to simulate login or use the API to authenticate with the code-server.
  2. Check for successful authentication and response.
- **Expected Outcome**: AI Agent successfully authenticates and connects to the code-server.
- **Actual Outcome**: Connection successful.
- **Status**: Passed

### Test Case 2: QuestDB Connection Validation (PostgreSQL)
- **Description**: Validate AI Agent's ability to connect to QuestDB through the PostgreSQL interface.
- **Steps**:
  1. Use a PostgreSQL client library to attempt a connection.
  2. Run a simple query (e.g., `SELECT version();`).
  3. Check for a successful response.
- **Expected Outcome**: AI Agent connects to QuestDB and retrieves query results.
- **Actual Outcome**: Query executed successfully.
- **Status**: Passed

### Test Case 3: Grafana Connection Validation
- **Description**: Ensure the AI Agent can communicate with Grafana's API for dashboard management.
- **Steps**:
  1. Use Grafanaâ€™s API to fetch or create a dashboard.
  2. Check for a successful API response.
- **Expected Outcome**: API responds successfully and confirms dashboard interaction.
- **Actual Outcome**: Grafana API connection established successfully.
- **Status**: Passed

### Test Case 4: OpenAI API Connection Validation
- **Description**: Verify that the AI Agent can send prompts and receive responses from the OpenAI API.
- **Steps**:
  1. Send a test prompt to the OpenAI API (e.g., generate a short text).
  2. Check the response for generated text.
- **Expected Outcome**: The OpenAI API returns a valid AI-generated response.
- **Actual Outcome**: OpenAI API responded successfully.
- **Status**: Passed



## User Interface Tests

### Test Case 1: AI Agent UI Response
- **Description**: Validate that the AI Agent UI correctly returns responses from the AI Agent.
- **Steps**:
  1. User sends a query through the UI.
  2. The AI Agent processes the query and returns the result.
- **Expected Outcome**: AI Agent UI returns the correct response based on the user's query.
- **Actual Outcome**: The response was returned as expected.
- **Status**: Passed

### Test Case 2: Error Handling in the UI
- **Description**: Test how the AI Agent UI handles invalid or unexpected inputs.
- **Steps**:
  1. User sends an invalid query.
  2. Check if the UI displays an appropriate error message.
- **Expected Outcome**: The UI should display a meaningful error message for invalid inputs.
- **Actual Outcome**: The error message was displayed as expected.
- **Status**: Passed

### Test Case 3: UI Performance Under Load
- **Description**: Ensure that the AI Agent UI handles high user traffic efficiently.
- **Steps**:
  1. Simulate multiple users sending queries simultaneously.
  2. Monitor the response times and check for slowdowns or errors.
- **Expected Outcome**: The UI should handle high traffic without significant delays or failures.
- **Actual Outcome**: The UI maintained performance under load.
- **Status**: Passed
