# AI Agent Development Plan

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the steps and tasks required to develop the AI Agent, which is responsible for processing user inputs, interacting with external services (QuestDB, Grafana, VS Code), and generating responses via the AI Agent UI.

## 2. Development Environment Setup

### 2.1. Docker and Docker Compose Configuration
- **Task**: Update the existing `docker-compose.yml` file to include the `ai-agent` service.
- **Details**:
  - Add the `ai-agent` service definition.
  - Configure environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `QUESTDB_PG_USER`, `QUESTDB_PG_PASSWORD`, `GRAFANA_API_KEY`, `VSCODE_API_KEY`).
  - Set up dependencies on QuestDB, Grafana, and VS Code.
  - Ensure the `LANGCHAIN_FRAMEWORK_CONFIG` is correctly pointed to the appropriate configuration file.

### 2.2. Dockerfile Creation
- **Task**: Create a Dockerfile for the AI Agent service.
- **Details**:
  - Base the image on a suitable Python image (`python:3.x`).
  - Install required dependencies (e.g., `langchain`, `psycopg2`, `requests`).
  - Copy the AI Agent code and configuration files into the Docker image.
  - Set the appropriate entry point for the AI Agent.

### 2.3. Local Environment Setup (Optional)
- **Task**: Set up a local Python virtual environment for development.
- **Details**:
  - Use `venv` or `conda` to create a virtual environment.
  - Install necessary Python packages (as listed in `requirements.txt`).
  - Set up environment variables locally for testing and development.

## 3. AI Agent Core Logic

### 3.1. Input Processing
- **Task**: Implement logic to handle user inputs received from the AI Agent UI.
- **Details**:
  - Define input formats (e.g., JSON).
  - Implement validation and sanitization of inputs.
  - Parse the input to determine the user's intent and required action.

### 3.2. Interaction with OpenAI API
- **Task**: Integrate the OpenAI API to process natural language inputs.
- **Details**:
  - Use the OpenAI Python SDK to send inputs to the GPT model.
  - Handle API responses, including error management and retry logic.
  - Extract and format the relevant information from the API response to send back to the UI.

### 3.3. Database Interaction with QuestDB
- **Task**: Implement database queries and interactions using QuestDB.
- **Details**:
  - Use `psycopg2` or SQLAlchemy to connect to QuestDB.
  - Write SQL queries to retrieve or store data as needed by the AI Agent.
  - Ensure proper handling of database connections and transactions.

### 3.4. Integration with Grafana
- **Task**: Set up communication between the AI Agent and Grafana for data visualization.
- **Details**:
  - Use Grafana’s API to fetch or update dashboards.
  - Implement logic to trigger Grafana visualizations based on user queries.
  - Handle API authentication using the `GRAFANA_API_KEY`.

### 3.5. Integration with VS Code
- **Task**: Implement code-related queries or tasks that interact with VS Code.
- **Details**:
  - Use VS Code API (or custom implementation) to handle code execution, file editing, etc.
  - Manage authentication using the `VSCODE_API_KEY`.
  - Define input/output formats for code-related tasks.

## 4. Performance and Optimization

### 4.1. API Efficiency
- **Task**: Optimize API calls to minimize latency.
- **Details**:
  - Implement request batching if possible.
  - Use caching mechanisms for frequently requested data or API calls.
  - Handle rate limiting gracefully.

### 4.2. Database Query Optimization
- **Task**: Optimize database interactions to ensure quick response times.
- **Details**:
  - Review and optimize SQL queries.
  - Implement indexing or other performance-enhancing database techniques.
  - Consider query caching where applicable.

### 4.3. Background Task Processing (Optional)
- **Task**: Implement background task processing for long-running tasks.
- **Details**:
  - Use Celery or another task queue to offload long-running processes.
  - Ensure tasks can be queued, executed asynchronously, and results communicated back to the AI Agent UI.

## 5. Testing and Debugging

### 5.1. Unit Testing
- **Task**: Write unit tests for the AI Agent’s core logic.
- **Details**:
  - Focus on input processing, API interactions, and database operations.
  - Use a testing framework like `pytest`.
  - Mock external dependencies (e.g., API calls, database connections).

### 5.2. Integration Testing
- **Task**: Test the integration between the AI Agent and external services.
- **Details**:
  - Verify that the AI Agent correctly interacts with QuestDB, Grafana, and VS Code.
  - Test real-world scenarios with the AI Agent UI.

### 5.3. Debugging
- **Task**: Debug any issues that arise during development and testing.
- **Details**:
  - Use logging and monitoring to trace issues.
  - Ensure proper error handling and reporting within the AI Agent.

## 6. Documentation

### 6.1. Code Documentation
- **Task**: Document the AI Agent’s codebase for maintainability.
- **Details**:
  - Add docstrings to functions, classes, and modules.
  - Comment on complex or non-obvious code sections.

### 6.2. User Documentation
- **Task**: Write usage instructions for the AI Agent.
- **Details**:
  - Create a `README.md` detailing setup, configuration, and usage.
  - Provide examples of input formats and expected outputs.

### 6.3. API Documentation
- **Task**: Document the API endpoints exposed by the AI Agent.
- **Details**:
  - List available API routes, parameters, and expected responses.
  - Provide examples for common API interactions.

## 7. Final Steps

### 7.1. Deployment Preparation
- **Task**: Prepare the AI Agent for deployment.
- **Details**:
  - Finalize Docker image and push to the Docker registry.
  - Ensure all environment variables and configurations are correctly set for production.

### 7.2. Final Testing
- **Task**: Conduct final testing in a staging environment.
- **Details**:
  - Verify all functionalities in an environment that mirrors production.
  - Conduct load testing to ensure performance under expected user load.

### 7.3. Deployment
- **Task**: Deploy the AI Agent to the production environment.
- **Details**:
  - Use the updated Docker Compose configuration to bring up all services.
  - Monitor logs and performance post-deployment to ensure stability.
